# Vermay Agent Web

This directory contains the standalone Next.js frontend for Vermay Agent. It is
kept in the same repository as the backend so the A2A routes, session/task
contracts, inspector UI, and approval workflow can evolve together.

## Development

Start the backend from the repository root:

```bash
vermay-agent serve --enable-a2a
```

Start the web UI from this directory:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The frontend proxies to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default. Override the backend
base URL with:

```bash
VERMAY_AGENT_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000 pnpm dev
```

## Checks

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
```

The web app is intentionally agent-specific. Reusable UI primitives should only
be extracted later if another non-agent product actually needs them.
